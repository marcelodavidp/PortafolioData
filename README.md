# PortfolioData @marcelodavidp

Hello! My name is Marcelo Palacios. I'm a business analyst with strong knowledge in Marketing and Sales. 

My portfolio is based on advanced data analysis for specific marketing or sales problems. 

However, I love creating data visualization dashboard to answer specific business questions and needs. 

#Framework by @marcelodavidp 

The common mistake in business analysis is not understanding the business issues.

There are a lot of frameworks for understanding business issues and 
building strong data projects and deliverables with high impact on business and final users.

In my personal opinion, there are two big phases:

 ##     1. Understand the business, strategy, and stakeholders.
 ##     2. Understand the business cases and the final users.

In the first phase:

I used 3 great tools:

      ### Business Model Canvas:
It defines the value proposition to the customer, how the business delivers the value proposition, and what the key resources are for that. In addition, it outlines the cost and sales structure for the business.
      ### Play to win strategy:
To understand what is important for the company or business unit in terms of success, where they play, how they play in the market, what the key capabilities and their gaps are, and the systems.
      ### Stakeholder maps:
Understand how many players are in the business, what their authority is, their technical level, and how they are involved in the data field.

In the second phase:
I used 2 great tools:

      ### User journey:
Understand how final users are involved with the project, at what part of their journey it will insert, and what other tools or processes they have.
      ### PACE framework:
A framework used by Google, and it's divided into:
            #### PLAN: Define the project, users, impact, and scope.
            #### ANALYZE: Compile data, explore data, clean data, descriptive statistics.
            #### CONSTRUCT: Visualize data, conduct hypothesis, build models (regressions, ML, etc.).
            #### EXECUTE: Communicate insights or implement data products with a clear process and process leader.

With these tools, the data analyst has the power to understand the business issues and lead to the development of any data project.
