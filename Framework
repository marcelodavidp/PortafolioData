#Framework by @marcelodavidp 

The common mistake in business analysis is not understanding the business issues.

There are a lot of frameworks for understanding business issues and building strong data projects and deliverables with high impact on business and final users.

In my personal opinion, there are two big phases: 
      1. Understand the business, strategy, and stakeholders
      2. Understand the business cases and de final users. 

In the first phases: 
      I used 3 great tools: 
            1. Business Model Canvas. 
                It defines de value proposition to the customer how the business delivers the value proposition, and what are the key resources for that. In addition, how is the cost and sales structure for business. 
            2. Play to win strategy 
                The fine, is what is important for the company or business unit in terms of successful, where they play, how they play in the market, what are the key capabilities and their gaps and the systems. 
            3. Stakeholder maps 
                Understand how  many players are in the business, what is their autorithy, their technical level and how they are involve in the data field.
